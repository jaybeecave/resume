## Summary
A passionate software developer specializing in full stack applications. I have 7 years experience with a strong technical ability in both C# and Golang, along with VueJS on the front end.

Having worked in contract positions for the last 3 years, I now realize how much I miss working with other developers and like minded people. I am now seeking a new opportunity with a strong team focus that will provide the next big challenge in my career.

Technical areas of interest are __DevOps__ and __React__, specifically the opportunity to work with __React Native__.

I was also directly involved with the launch of a __Cordova__ based mobile application [Speaking Email](https://speaking.email "Listen to email &amp; manage your inbox by voice control - app for iPhone &amp; Android - Speaking Email") - a subscription based email client that reads your email out loud.

I was approached by Unitec to teach Software Applications in the Certificate in Information Technology. The course covered Excel, Access and Word, with a focus on introducing students to basic logic using conditional statements in Excel and teaching them about relational databases in Access. 
This role required me to be very confident in communicating ideas and concepts to a large group of people and be well organised in preparing course material and keeping the students within schedule.
